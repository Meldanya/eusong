# eusong

A small application that tries to guess which country will win the
Eurovision Song Contest 2013 by looking at how many YouTube views each
country has.

Inspired by Andreas Ekström's
[TedxTalk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzXQDXCfEcA).

eusong, short for Eurovision Song, is pronounced similarly to how the
Pokémon Dewgong is pronounced (but obviously with other letters).

## Running it

It is currently running at http://eusong.meldanya.se/ (on Heroku) but if
you want to run it locally here are the instructions:

```bash
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to view it.
